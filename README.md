# Audulus-Library-Canvas-Node

The Canvas node in Audulus 4 uses Lua to draw graphics. It works with an implementation of ![vger](https://github.com/audulus/vger).

In the Canvas node, you are given several ![built-in](/code/builtins.lua) functions to draw lines, rectangles, circles, and text. The functions in this library extend these built-in functions to make it easier to draw more complex graphics.
